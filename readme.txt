Found the image in a random website.
Then suddenly I though why not find out where the center of mass goes as the coins are placed.
The simulation is ideal in the sense that all the coins are identical, and they are placed in a specific distance.
It is evident that the structure being symmetric the center of mass will be in a axis that goes through the cetre of the structure when looked from above.

The simulation is done in a greyscale fashion being easier. Coins are black. They are subsequently made dimmer as new layers are added.
A total of 14 layers.

Open Matlab, and run main.m to start the simulation. Might require image processing toolbox.
